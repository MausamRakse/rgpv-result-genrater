🎬 Advanced Scene Generator

An interactive Streamlit app that lets you build visual scenes by combining a background image with multiple character sprites.
The app supports prompt-driven auto-placement, per-character controls, and exports to PNG, JSON, and PDF documentation.

🚀 Features

Natural Language Placement

Detects keywords like left, right, top, bottom, center from your prompt.

Auto-places characters accordingly.

Action Extraction

Tags actions such as waving, sitting, reading, running, etc. from the prompt.

Stored as metadata in scene JSON and PDF.

Character Management

Upload multiple characters (transparent PNG/webp recommended).

Adjust position, scale, flip horizontally, z-order, and rename.

Background Support

Upload any background image or use a blank canvas.

Adjustable canvas size (default: 1280×720).

Exports

PNG (composed scene)

JSON (scene data structure)

PDF (documentation with scene preview, character details, reflections/notes)
